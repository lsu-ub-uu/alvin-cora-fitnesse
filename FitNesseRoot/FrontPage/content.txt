Acceptance tests and documentation for Alvin

The Alvin Tests page on FitNesse is a comprehensive test suite for the Cora system.
The suite is organized into categories and subcategories, and includes tests that:

    Call Java code directly
    Manage locations
    Handle metadata
    Test login functionality 

Specific tests cover creating, reading, updating, and deleting locations, as well as verifying that metadata and record types work correctly.
Login tests ensure that the IDP login behaves as expected.

FitNesse also provides tools to edit, organize, and run these tests directly in the system.
