!1 Testing deleting a place
It should be possible to delete places through the REST API.

!***> Create a new place

First we create a place, to later be able to delete it

!| RecordEndpointFixture |
| authToken | type | json | testCreateRecordCreatedType? | getStatusType? | getCreatedId? |
| $adminAuthToken | place | {"name":"authority","children":[{"name":"recordInfo","children":[{"name":"dataDivider","children":[{"name":"linkedRecordType","value":"system"},{"name":"linkedRecordId","value":"alvin"}]}]},{"name":"name","children":[{"name":"namePart","children":[{"name":"value","value":"Fitnesse place to be deleted"}],"attributes":{"type":"defaultName"}}],"attributes":{"type":"authorized"}}],"attributes":{"type":"place"}} | place | CREATED | $createdId= |

*!
!***> Read newly created place as Json

!| RecordEndpointFixture |
| authToken | type | id | testReadRecord? | getStatusType? |
| $adminAuthToken | place | $createdId | =~/"value":"Fitnesse place to be deleted"/ | OK |

*!
!***> List places

There are 6 places with the newly created place

!| RecordEndpointFixture |
| authToken | type | testReadRecordList? | getStatusType? |
| $adminAuthToken | place | | OK |

*!
!***> Delete newly created place

!| RecordEndpointFixture |
| authToken | type | id | testDeleteRecord? | getStatusType? |
| $adminAuthToken | place | $createdId | | OK |

*!
!***> Try to read deleted place

!| RecordEndpointFixture |
| authToken | type | id | testReadRecord? | getStatusType? |
| $adminAuthToken | place | $createdId | | NOT_FOUND |

*!
!***> List places - places with state DELETED is excluded



!| RecordEndpointFixture |
| authToken | type | testReadRecordList? | getStatusType? |
| $adminAuthToken | place | | OK |
